*Since Camel {since}*

*{component-header}*

The Google Storage component provides access to https://cloud.google.com/storage/[Cloud Storage] via
the https://github.com/googleapis/java-storage[google java storage library].

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml
for this component:

[source,xml]
------------------------------------------------------
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-google-storage</artifactId>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
    <version>x.x.x</version>
</dependency>

[[GoogleStorage-AuthenticationConfiguration]]

== Authentication Configuration

Google Storage component authentication is targeted for use with the GCP Service Accounts.
For more information please refer to https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/reference/libraries#setting_up_authentication[Google Storage Auth Guide].

When you have the **service account key** you can provide authentication credentials to your application code.
Google security credentials can be set explicitly by providing the path to the GCP credentials file location.

[source,text]
--------------------------------------------------------
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/home/user/Downloads/my-key.json"
--------------------------------------------------------

or directly through the component endpoint
[source,text]
--------------------------------------------------------
from("google-storage://myCamelBucket?serviceAccountCredentials=/home/user/Downloads/my-key.json")

== Options

// component options: START
The Google Storage component supports 16 options, which are listed below.



[width="100%",cols="2,5,^1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| *autoCreateBucket* (common) | Setting the autocreation of the bucket bucketName. | true | boolean
| *configuration* (common) | The component configuration |  | GoogleCloudStorageComponentConfiguration
| *objectName* (common) | objectName |  | String
| *serviceAccountCredentials* (common) | Specify the service account credentials file (json) |  | String
| *storageClient* (common) | Set strage client |  | Storage
| *bridgeErrorHandler* (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean
| *deleteAfterRead* (consumer) | Delete objects from S3 after they have been retrieved. The delete is only performed if the Exchange is committed. If a rollback occurs, the object is not deleted. If this option is false, then the same objects will be retrieve over and over again on the polls. Therefore you need to use the Idempotent Consumer EIP in the route to filter out duplicates. You can filter using the AWS2S3Constants#BUCKET_NAME and AWS2S3Constants#KEY headers, or only the AWS2S3Constants#KEY header. | true | boolean
| *destinationBucket* (consumer) | Define the destination bucket where an object must be moved when moveAfterRead is set to true. |  | String
| *destinationBucketPrefix* (consumer) | Define the destination bucket prefix to use when an object must be moved and moveAfterRead is set to true. |  | String
| *destinationBucketSuffix* (consumer) | Define the destination bucket suffix to use when an object must be moved and moveAfterRead is set to true. |  | String
| *includeBody* (consumer) | If it is true, the S3Object exchange will be consumed and put into the body and closed. If false the S3Object stream will be put raw into the body and the headers will be set with the S3 object metadata. This option is strongly related to autocloseBody option. In case of setting includeBody to true because the S3Object stream will be consumed then it will also be closed in case of includeBody false then it will be up to the caller to close the S3Object stream. However setting autocloseBody to true when includeBody is false it will schedule to close the S3Object stream automatically on exchange completion. | true | boolean
| *includeFolders* (consumer) | If it is true, the folders/directories will be consumed. If it is false, they will be ignored, and Exchanges will not be created for those | true | boolean
| *moveAfterRead* (consumer) | Move objects from S3 bucket to a different bucket after they have been retrieved. To accomplish the operation the destinationBucket option must be set. The copy bucket operation is only performed if the Exchange is committed. If a rollback occurs, the object is not moved. | false | boolean
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean
| *operation* (producer) | set the operation for the producer. There are 7 enums and the value can be one of: copyObject, listObjects, deleteObject, deleteBucket, listBuckets, getObject, getObjectRange |  | GoogleCloudStorageComponentOperations
| *autowiredEnabled* (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean

The Google Storage endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

----
google-storage:bucketName

with the following path and query parameters:

=== Path Parameters (1 parameters):

| *exchangePattern* (consumer) | Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange. There are 3 enums and the value can be one of: InOnly, InOut, InOptionalOut |  | ExchangePattern
| *pollStrategy* (consumer) | A pluggable org.apache.camel.PollingConsumerPollingStrategy allowing you to provide your custom implementation to control error handling usually occurred during the poll operation before an Exchange have been created and being routed in Camel. |  | PollingConsumerPollStrategy
| *lazyStartProducer* (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel's routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean

| *backoffMultiplier* (scheduler) | To let the scheduled polling consumer backoff if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row.

| *repeatCount* (scheduler) | Specifies a maximum limit of number of fires. So if you set it to 1, the scheduler will only fire once. If you set it to 5, it will only fire five times. A value of zero or negative means fire forever. | 0 | long
| *runLoggingLevel* (scheduler) | The consumer logs a start/complete log line when it polls. This option allows you to configure the logging level for that. There are 6 enums and the value can be one of: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, OFF | TRACE | LoggingLevel
